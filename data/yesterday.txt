Your love's the sweetest sound
Around u my heart just pounds
Your touch I'll write it down
So high I can't come down
Was hopeless took notice
Baby like a siren
And u gave me faith
You're the answer all my problems solved
Life with u is so beautiful
I won't trade it away
I was lost but found my purpose now
I'm glad you're keepin' me around
I won't trade it away
Whether I'm up or down
Or I wear no crown
Love me the same way the same way
U did as yesterday
Whether I'm rich or poor
Just call me yours
Love me the same way the same way
U did as yesterday
Oh oh
Oh oh
Did as yesterday
Your smile is all I need
Without u these lungs can't breathe
I'd fall from the sky for u
Wanna do better and thrive for u
Was hopeless took notice
Baby like a siren
And u gave me faith
You're the answer all my problems solved
Life with u is so beautiful
I won't trade it away
I was lost but found my purpose now
I'm glad you're keepin' me around
And I won't trade it away
Whether I'm up or down
Or I wear no crown
Love me the same way the same way
U did as yesterday
Whether I'm rich or poor
Just call me yours
Love me the same way the same way
U did as yesterday
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
